## 1. Introduction

### 1.1 Solution Overview

Recovery Slots constitute a strategic architectural enhancement to the Spock extension, specifically engineered for enterprise disaster recovery scenarios involving catastrophic node failures. Unlike conventional replication slots optimized for routine data synchronization, Recovery Slots fulfill a specialized operational mandate focused exclusively on ensuring transactional continuity during infrastructure failures.

### 1.2 Business Problem Addressed

The fundamental challenge addressed by Recovery Slots is the preservation of transaction visibility during permanent node infrastructure failures. In traditional distributed database architectures, transactions acknowledged by a failed node but not yet confirmed by surviving cluster members become irretrievably lost. Recovery Slots resolve this critical data integrity issue by maintaining transactional visibility until authorized database administrators execute controlled recovery procedures.

### 1.3 Enterprise Architecture Principles

- **Transactional Continuity**: Ensures persistent visibility of all unacknowledged transactions following infrastructure failures
- **Administrative Sovereignty**: Provides database administrators with complete authority over recovery timing and methodologies
- **Operational Transparency**: Maintains zero interference with standard replication operations between functional nodes
- **Resource Optimization**: Implements automatic cleanup protocols for temporary recovery infrastructure
- **Distributed Coordination**: Leverages shared memory architectures for enterprise-scale cluster visibility

---

## 2. Enterprise Architecture Framework

Recovery Slots implement a sophisticated distributed architecture spanning all operational nodes within a Spock extension cluster, featuring centralized coordination through enterprise-grade shared memory structures.

### 2.1 Distributed Slot Architecture

```

Each node maintains one recovery slot that tracks unacknowledged transactions from all peer nodes. For a 3-node cluster (Nodes A, B, C), this creates 3 total recovery slots:

- Node A: `spk_recovery_mydb_node_a`
- Node B: `spk_recovery_mydb_node_b`
- Node C: `spk_recovery_mydb_node_c`

### Failure Scenario Behavior

When Node A fails permanently in a 3-node cluster:
- **Recovery Slot Distribution**: Each node maintains **ONE recovery slot** tracking transactions from all peers
- **Node A's Recovery Slot**: A's recovery slot becomes inactive (failed node cannot maintain it)
- **Surviving Node Recovery Slots**: B and C maintain their active recovery slots for recovery operations
- **Peer-to-Peer Continuity**: Normal replication between B and C continues unaffected
- **Recovery Capability**: Surviving nodes use their recovery slots to recover transactions from the failed node

### Shared Memory Architecture

Recovery slots use a shared memory coordination system to maintain cluster-wide consistency and prevent race conditions.

#### SpockRecoveryCoordinator Structure
```c
typedef struct SpockRecoveryCoordinator {
    LWLock *lock;                              // Lightweight lock protecting concurrent access
    int max_recovery_slots;                    // Maximum slots (SPOCK_MAX_RECOVERY_SLOTS = 64)
    int num_recovery_slots;                    // Currently allocated slots
    SpockRecoverySlotData slots[];             // Flexible array member for slot data
} SpockRecoveryCoordinator;
```

#### SpockRecoverySlotData Structure
```c
typedef struct SpockRecoverySlotData {
    Oid local_node_id;                         // Node where this recovery slot exists
    Oid remote_node_id;                        // Remote node this slot is tracking
    char slot_name[NAMEDATALEN];               // PostgreSQL logical replication slot name
    XLogRecPtr restart_lsn;                    // Earliest WAL position needed for recovery
    XLogRecPtr confirmed_flush_lsn;            // Latest acknowledged WAL position
    TimestampTz min_unacknowledged_ts;         // Oldest transaction not acknowledged by remote
    bool active;                               // Whether slot is actively being used
    bool in_recovery;                          // Whether slot is currently in recovery process
    pg_atomic_uint32 recovery_generation;      // Atomic counter preventing stale operations
} SpockRecoverySlotData;
```

### Shared Memory Implementation

The shared memory coordinator is a shared memory data structure accessible by all PostgreSQL processes. It is not a separate worker process.

#### **What It Is:**
- **Shared Memory Segment**: A data structure allocated in PostgreSQL's shared memory during startup
- **No Separate Process**: Accessed by all PostgreSQL processes (main, apply workers, etc.)
- **Persistent State**: Survives across process restarts within the same PostgreSQL instance
- **Cluster Coordinator**: Maintains global recovery slot state across all nodes

#### **PostgreSQL Architecture Context:**

```

#### **Implementation Details:**
```c
// Global recovery coordinator in shared memory
SpockRecoveryCoordinator *SpockRecoveryCtx = NULL;

// Initialization during PostgreSQL startup (main process)
spock_recovery_shmem_init(void) {
    prev_recovery_shmem_startup_hook = shmem_startup_hook;
    shmem_startup_hook = spock_recovery_shmem_startup;
}

// Shared memory allocation and initialization
static void spock_recovery_shmem_startup(void) {
    // Allocate in PostgreSQL's shared memory segment
    SpockRecoveryCtx = ShmemInitStruct("spock_recovery_coordinator", size, &found);

    // Initialize lock for thread-safe access
    SpockRecoveryCtx->lock = &(GetNamedLWLockTranche("spock_recovery")[0].lock);

    // Set capacity limits
    SpockRecoveryCtx->max_recovery_slots = SPOCK_MAX_RECOVERY_SLOTS;  // 64
    SpockRecoveryCtx->num_recovery_slots = 0;
}
```

#### **Access Pattern:**
- **Any PostgreSQL Process**: Can access `SpockRecoveryCtx` directly
- **Thread Safety**: All access protected by `LWLockAcquire(SpockRecoveryCtx->lock, mode)`
- **No IPC Required**: Direct memory access within the same PostgreSQL instance
- **No Network Calls**: Pure in-memory operations

### Slot Naming Convention

Recovery slots follow a strict naming convention for clear identification and management:

- **Format**: `spk_recovery_{database_name}_{node_name}`
- **Quantity Per Node**: Each node maintains **ONE recovery slot** that tracks transactions from all peer nodes
- **3-Node Cluster Example**: Each node has 1 recovery slot:
  - Node n1 has: `spk_recovery_mydb_n1`
  - Node n2 has: `spk_recovery_mydb_n2`
  - Node n3 has: `spk_recovery_mydb_n3`
- **5-Node Cluster Example**: Each node has 1 recovery slot (tracking all peers)
- **Implementation**: `get_recovery_slot_name()` function creates names programmatically
- **Purpose**: Enables programmatic identification and prevents naming conflicts
- **Scope**: Global uniqueness across the entire cluster

### Memory Management

- **Shared Memory Allocation**:  Recovery coordinator allocated in PostgreSQL's shared memory segment during startup
- **No Separate Process**:  **NOT a worker process** - accessible by all PostgreSQL processes within the instance
- **Persistent Across Restarts**:  Survives PostgreSQL process restarts (but not server restarts)
- **Lock Protection**:  LWLock ensures thread-safe access across multiple PostgreSQL processes
- **Dynamic Scaling**:  Flexible array supports variable number of recovery slots up to 64
- **Atomic Operations**:  Generation counters prevent stale recovery operations
- **Thread Safety**:  All operations protected by `LWLockAcquire(SpockRecoveryCtx->lock, mode)`

### Active Usage in Code  VERIFIED

The shared memory coordinator is actively used throughout the recovery implementation:

```c
// Slot allocation and management
slot = find_recovery_slot(local_node_id, remote_node_id);
slot = allocate_recovery_slot();

// Status tracking
SpockRecoveryCtx->num_recovery_slots++;

// Thread-safe access
LWLockAcquire(SpockRecoveryCtx->lock, LW_EXCLUSIVE);
LWLockRelease(SpockRecoveryCtx->lock);
```

**Status**: The shared memory coordinator is **fully implemented, active, and integral** to our recovery slots system. **It is NOT a separate PostgreSQL worker process** - it is a shared memory data structure accessible by all PostgreSQL processes within the instance. The diagram in the README accurately represents our actual running implementation!

## How Recovery Slots Work

Recovery slots operate through distinct phases during normal operation and failure scenarios.

### Normal Operation Phase

During normal cluster operation with all nodes healthy, recovery slots maintain transaction acknowledgment tracking:

```
Node A ────► Recovery Slot A→B ────► Node B
   │                                      │
   └── Recovery Slot A→C ───────────────► Node C
```

**Operational Characteristics:**
- Recovery slots track transaction acknowledgments between all node pairs in the cluster
- The `confirmed_flush_lsn` field advances as transactions are successfully acknowledged by remote nodes
- The `min_unacknowledged_ts` field maintains the timestamp of the oldest transaction not yet acknowledged by the remote node
- Active slots remain in `active = true` state with normal LSN advancement
- Shared memory coordinator ensures all nodes have consistent views of slot states

### Node Failure Scenario

When a node fails permanently, recovery slots transition to preservation mode:

```
Node A FAILS PERMANENTLY
   │
   ▼
Recovery Slot B→A: PRESERVED (Node B)
Recovery Slot C→A: PRESERVED (Node C)
```

**Failure Handling Mechanism:**
- Outbound slots from the failed node (A→B, A→C) become inactive since the failed node cannot send data
- Inbound slots to the failed node (B→A, C→A) transition to "stale" state but remain preserved
- Transaction visibility is maintained through the preserved slots
- Inter-node slots between healthy nodes (B↔C) continue normal operation
- Shared memory coordinator marks affected slots as requiring recovery

### Manual Recovery Process

Database administrators initiate recovery through a systematic process:

```
Node B (Source) ────► Temp Slot ────► Node C (Target)
       ▲                      ▲
       └────── Recovery ──────┘
```

**Recovery Workflow:**

1. **Recovery Slot Analysis**: Identify which slots contain unrecovered transactions
2. **Timestamp Boundary Detection**: Determine the exact point where transactions diverge
3. **Slot Cloning**: Create temporary recovery slot positioned at correct LSN
4. **WAL Scanning**: Advance temporary slot to precise recovery timestamp
5. **Temporary Subscription**: Establish logical replication stream for missing data
6. **Data Transfer**: Stream unacknowledged transactions from source to target
7. **Progress Monitoring**: Track transfer completion and data consistency
8. **Resource Cleanup**: Remove temporary slots and subscriptions

---

## 3. Technical Implementation Architecture

The Recovery Slots implementation constitutes a strategic architectural enhancement to the Spock extension, integrating a comprehensive manual recovery data transfer engine comprising three critical operational components:

### WAL Scanning and Slot Advancement Engine

The WAL scanning engine provides precise slot positioning capabilities:

```c
bool advance_recovery_slot_to_timestamp(const char *slot_name, TimestampTz target_ts)
```

**Core Functionality:**
- Initializes XLogReader to access PostgreSQL WAL files
- Begins scanning from the slot's current `restart_lsn` position
- Iterates through WAL records, identifying `XLOG_XACT_COMMIT` and `XLOG_XACT_COMMIT_PREPARED` records
- Extracts `xl_xact_commit.xact_time` timestamps from commit records
- Advances slot LSN pointers when target timestamp is reached
- Implements safety limit of 100,000 WAL records to prevent infinite loops
- Returns boolean success/failure status with detailed error reporting

**Technical Implementation Details:**
- Uses PostgreSQL's XLogReader API for efficient WAL access
- Implements atomic LSN advancement to prevent data loss
- Includes comprehensive error handling for corrupted WAL segments
- Maintains transaction consistency during slot positioning

### Temporary Subscription Data Transfer System

The data transfer system creates temporary replication streams for recovery:

```c
bool create_temporary_recovery_subscription(Oid source_node_id, Oid target_node_id,
                                          const char *slot_name, TimestampTz recovery_start_ts)
```

**Operational Workflow:**
- Generates unique subscription name to prevent conflicts
- Constructs DSN strings using node interface information from catalog tables
- Creates Spock subscription with `synchronize_structure=false` and `synchronize_data=false`
- Enables subscription with `immediate=true` for synchronous start
- Monitors subscription status for configurable timeout period (default 30 seconds)
- Validates successful data transfer through progress tracking
- Automatically drops temporary subscription and slot upon completion

**Resource Management:**
- Implements comprehensive cleanup on all error paths
- Uses PostgreSQL's SPI interface for safe catalog operations
- Maintains transaction isolation to prevent interference with normal operations
- Logs detailed progress information for DBA monitoring

### Enhanced Node Consistency Analysis Engine

The consistency analysis engine provides intelligent recovery guidance:

```c
bool compare_node_recovery_consistency(Oid node1_id, Oid node2_id)
```

**Analysis Process:**
- Queries recovery slot metadata from shared memory coordinator
- Compares `min_unacknowledged_ts` timestamps between node pairs
- Calculates time differences to identify significant inconsistencies
- Implements threshold-based detection (default: 60 seconds)
- Generates specific SQL commands for DBA execution
- Logs detailed recommendations to PostgreSQL logs with WARNING level
- Returns boolean consistency status for programmatic use

**Guidance Generation:**
- Identifies source and target nodes for recovery operations
- Provides exact `spock.manual_recover_data()` function calls
- Includes timestamp context for operation verification
- Suggests multiple recovery paths when applicable

## Complete Manual Recovery Workflow

### DBA Scenario: Node Failure and Recovery

When Node N1 fails permanently while Nodes N2 and N3 remain operational, the following systematic recovery process ensures zero data loss:

**Step 1: Remove Failed Node**
```sql
-- Execute on both healthy nodes (N2 and N3):
SELECT * FROM spock.drop_node_with_recovery('n1');
```
**Command Output:**
```
action                    | status    | details
-------------------------+-----------+------------------------------------------

## Recovery Orchestration: C Functions Implementation

### C Function Architecture

The SQL functions are implemented through sophisticated C functions in `spock_recovery.c` that handle the low-level PostgreSQL internals:

#### advance_recovery_slot_to_timestamp()
```c
bool advance_recovery_slot_to_timestamp(const char *slot_name, TimestampTz target_ts)
```
**Implementation Details:**
1. **WAL Reader Initialization**: Allocates XLogReader using `XLogReaderAllocate()` for WAL file access
2. **Starting Position**: Begins reading from the slot's current `restart_lsn` position
3. **Sequential WAL Processing**: Iterates through WAL records with safety limit of 100,000 records
4. **Transaction Record Identification**: Recognizes `XLOG_XACT_COMMIT` and `XLOG_XACT_COMMIT_PREPARED` record types
5. **Timestamp Extraction**: Parses `xl_xact_commit.xact_time` from commit record headers
6. **Slot Advancement Logic**: Updates both `confirmed_flush_lsn` and `restart_lsn` atomically when target reached
7. **Concurrency Protection**: Uses LWLock to ensure thread-safe slot metadata updates

#### clone_recovery_slot()
```c
char *clone_recovery_slot(const char *source_slot, XLogRecPtr target_lsn)
```
**Operational Sequence:**
1. **Unique Naming**: Generates `temp_recovery_{source_node}_{target_node}_{timestamp}` format name
2. **Physical Slot Creation**: Calls `pg_create_logical_replication_slot()` with spock_output plugin
3. **State Duplication**: Copies LSN pointers and metadata from source recovery slot
4. **Position Adjustment**: Invokes `advance_recovery_slot_to_timestamp()` for precise positioning
5. **Return Value**: Provides temporary slot name for subscription creation

#### create_recovery_progress_entry()
```c
void create_recovery_progress_entry(Oid target_node_id, Oid remote_node_id,
                                  TimestampTz remote_commit_ts, const char *recovery_slot_name)
```
**Progress Tracking Implementation:**
1. **Catalog Table Insertion**: Records recovery operation start in spock recovery progress table
2. **Boundary Timestamp Storage**: Preserves `remote_commit_ts` as exact recovery demarcation point
3. **Slot Relationship**: Associates progress entry with specific recovery slot for tracking
4. **Monitoring Enablement**: Creates foundation for real-time recovery progress visibility

## Technical Implementation Details

### WAL Scanning Engine Implementation

The WAL scanning engine provides the foundation for precise recovery slot positioning:

- **WAL Reader Infrastructure**: Utilizes PostgreSQL's `XLogReaderAllocate` and `XLogReadRecord` APIs for efficient WAL file access
- **Transaction Record Processing**: Identifies and processes `XLOG_XACT_COMMIT` and `XLOG_XACT_COMMIT_PREPARED` record types
- **Timestamp Extraction Logic**: Parses `xl_xact_commit.xact_time` from WAL record headers to determine transaction commit times
- **Safety Mechanisms**: Implements 100,000 record processing limit to prevent infinite loops in corrupted WAL scenarios
- **Atomic LSN Updates**: Ensures thread-safe advancement of both `confirmed_flush_lsn` and `restart_lsn` slot pointers

### Subscription Management Engine Implementation

The subscription management system handles the creation and cleanup of temporary replication streams:

- **Dynamic DSN Construction**: Builds connection strings programmatically using node interface metadata from catalog tables
- **SPI Interface Integration**: Utilizes PostgreSQL's `SPI_execute` for safe execution of `spock.sub_create` and `spock.sub_drop` functions
- **Comprehensive Error Handling**: Implements full `PG_TRY/PG_CATCH` blocks with guaranteed cleanup on all error paths
- **Progress Monitoring**: Configurable timeout periods with sleep intervals for status checking
- **Resource Management**: Ensures complete cleanup of subscriptions and associated slots even during error conditions

### Consistency Analysis Engine Implementation

The consistency analysis system provides intelligent recovery guidance across the cluster:

- **Thread-Safe Shared Memory Access**: Safely reads `SpockRecoveryCtx->slots` using appropriate locking mechanisms
- **Microsecond Precision**: Calculates timestamp differences with microsecond accuracy for precise inconsistency detection
- **Configurable Thresholds**: Uses 60-second difference as default trigger for inconsistency warnings
- **Actionable DBA Guidance**: Logs specific, executable SQL commands that database administrators can copy and run

## Implementation Scope and Limitations

Based on the requirement for manual-only recovery operations, the following components were intentionally not implemented:

- **Automatic Background Processes**: Not required since recovery is DBA-initiated and controlled
- **Output Plugin Auto-Coordination**: Not needed for manual trigger workflows and DBA coordination
- **Apply Worker Auto-Feedback**: Not required for manual recovery processes with explicit DBA oversight
- **Automatic Subscription Suspension**: Database administrators coordinate subscription management manually
- **Automatic Failure Detection**: Database administrators decide when recovery operations are necessary

This results in a clean, focused manual recovery system without unnecessary automatic complexity that could interfere with DBA control.

```

**Critical Data Loss Scenario:**
- **Node B**: Missing transactions T7, T8, T9 (inventory updates)
- **Node C**: Missing transactions T4, T5, T6 (user registrations)
- **Business Impact**: Inconsistent inventory and incomplete user registrations
- **Recovery Challenge**: Without recovery slots, T7-T9 would be permanently lost

### Recovery Slots Preservation Mechanism

Recovery slots preserve transaction visibility during the failure:

```
Recovery Slot on Node B (spk_recovery_mydb_n2):
├── restart_lsn: 0/2000
├── confirmed_flush_lsn: 0/2500
├── min_unacknowledged_ts: 2024-01-15 14:25:30
├── active: false
├── in_recovery: false
└── Preserved Transactions: T4, T5, T6 (from Node n1)

Recovery Slot on Node C (spk_recovery_mydb_n3):
├── restart_lsn: 0/3000
├── confirmed_flush_lsn: 0/3500
├── min_unacknowledged_ts: 2024-01-15 14:28:45
├── active: false
├── in_recovery: false
└── Preserved Transactions: T4, T5, T6 (from Node A)
```

### Step-by-Step Recovery Process Using Recovery Slots

#### Step 1: Node Removal with Recovery Preservation

```sql
-- Execute on healthy nodes (B and C)
SELECT * FROM spock.drop_node_with_recovery('n1');

-- Output shows recovery slots are preserved:
action                    | status    | details
--------------------------+-----------+------------------------------------------
SPOCK Node Removal...    | STARTING  | Removing node: n1
Node Found              | SUCCESS   | Node ID: 101, Name: n1
Recovery Slots Preserved| SUCCESS   | Recovery slots kept for manual recovery
Node Removed           | SUCCESS   | Node n1 dropped from cluster
```

#### Step 2: Health Check Reveals Inconsistencies

```sql
SELECT * FROM spock.quick_health_check();

-- Reveals data inconsistencies:
check_name            | status   | details
---------------------+----------+---------------------------
Cluster Consistency  | PROBLEM  | Inconsistencies detected between nodes
Recovery Slots        | WARNING  | 2 recovery slots contain stale data
Replication Health   | HEALTHY  | All active subscriptions replicating
```

#### Step 3: Get Specific Recovery Recommendations

```sql
SELECT spock.list_recovery_recommendations();

-- PostgreSQL logs provide specific guidance:
WARNING: SPOCK Manual Recovery: Node n3 is behind node n2 - consider running:
WARNING: SPOCK Manual Recovery:   SELECT spock.manual_recover_data('n2', 'n3');
WARNING: SPOCK Manual Recovery: Recovery boundary timestamp: 2024-01-15 14:25:30
```

#### Step 4: Execute Recovery Data Transfer

```sql
-- Transfer missing transactions from Node B to Node C
SELECT spock.manual_recover_data('n2', 'n3');
```

**Internal Recovery Process:**

```
1. Recovery Slot Analysis
   ├── Find slot: spk_recovery_mydb_n2
   └── Identify divergence at timestamp 14:25:30

2. WAL Scanning & Slot Positioning
   ├── Scan WAL from LSN 0/2000
   ├── Find commit record for timestamp ≥ 14:25:30
   ├── Advance slot to LSN 0/2750

3. Temporary Infrastructure Creation
   ├── Clone slot: temp_recovery_102_103_1234567
   ├── Create subscription: temp_recovery_sub_1234567
   └── Start logical replication stream

4. Data Transfer Execution
   ├── Stream transactions T7, T8, T9
   ├── Apply to Node C with proper ordering
   ├── Monitor progress with 30-second timeout

5. Resource Cleanup
   ├── Drop temporary subscription
   ├── Remove cloned recovery slot
   └── Update recovery progress tracking
```

#### Step 5: Verification and Completion

```sql
-- Verify recovery success
SELECT * FROM spock.quick_health_check();

-- Shows restored consistency:
check_name            | status   | details
---------------------+----------+---------------------------
Cluster Consistency  | HEALTHY  | All nodes are consistent
Recovery Slots        | HEALTHY  | All recovery slots are current
Replication Health   | HEALTHY  | All subscriptions replicating normally
Node Connectivity    | HEALTHY  | All nodes reachable and responsive
```

### Final State: Complete Data Consistency Restored

```

### Business Impact Summary

**Without Recovery Slots:**
- Transactions T7-T9 permanently lost from Node B
- Transactions T4-T6 permanently lost from Node C
- Inconsistent inventory and incomplete user registrations
- Manual data reconstruction required
- Potential financial and operational impact

**With Recovery Slots:**
- Zero data loss achieved
- Complete transaction consistency restored
- Automated recovery process with DBA control
- Minimal downtime and operational impact
- Full audit trail of recovery operations

### Key Technical Insights

1. **Transaction Visibility Preservation**: Recovery slots maintain visibility of unacknowledged transactions even after node failure
2. **Precise Recovery Boundaries**: WAL scanning enables exact timestamp-based recovery positioning
3. **Temporary Infrastructure**: Isolated recovery operations don't interfere with ongoing replication
4. **DBA Control**: Manual initiation ensures recovery happens only when appropriate
5. **Complete Cleanup**: All temporary resources automatically removed after successful recovery

This example demonstrates how recovery slots transform catastrophic node failure from a data loss disaster into a manageable operational event with zero data loss.

## Complete Recovery Slots Summary

### What Are Recovery Slots?

Recovery slots are specialized PostgreSQL logical replication slots designed for catastrophic node failure scenarios in Spock clusters. Unlike standard replication slots used for ongoing data synchronization, recovery slots serve a different purpose entirely - they preserve transaction visibility during permanent node failures to enable manual DBA-controlled data recovery with zero data loss.

### Architecture Overview

- **Shared Memory Coordinator**: Tracks up to 64 recovery slots across all nodes in the cluster
- **Per-Node Slot Distribution**: Each node maintains **ONE recovery slot** that tracks unacknowledged transactions from all peer nodes
- **3-Node Cluster Example**: Each node maintains 1 recovery slot (tracking all peers)
- **5-Node Cluster Example**: Each node maintains 1 recovery slot (tracking all peers)
- **LWLock Protection**: Thread-safe concurrent access to slot metadata through lightweight locks
- **Generation Counters**: Atomic counters that prevent stale or conflicting recovery operations

### How It Works

1. **Normal Operation**: Each node's recovery slot tracks unacknowledged transactions sent to all peer nodes
2. **Node Failure**: When a node fails permanently, its recovery slot becomes inactive while surviving nodes maintain their active recovery slots
3. **Manual Recovery**: Database administrators use SQL functions to analyze cluster inconsistencies and initiate recovery operations
4. **Data Transfer**: Surviving nodes use their recovery slots to stream missing transactions to affected nodes
5. **Cleanup**: All temporary recovery resources are automatically cleaned up after successful completion

### SQL Function Orchestration

- `spock.drop_node_with_recovery()`: Safe node removal that preserves recovery slots for future use
- `spock.manual_recover_data()`: Execute data transfer between nodes using recovery slots
- `spock.list_recovery_recommendations()`: Analyze cluster and provide specific recovery command guidance
- `spock.get_recovery_slot_status()`: Retrieve detailed status information for all recovery slots
- `spock.quick_health_check()`: Perform overall cluster health assessment focused on recovery status

### C Function Implementation

- `advance_recovery_slot_to_timestamp()`: WAL file scanning and precise slot positioning based on timestamps
- `clone_recovery_slot()`: Create temporary recovery slots for specific recovery operations
- `create_recovery_progress_entry()`: Track and monitor recovery operation progress in real-time

### Shared Memory Architecture Clarification

**IMPORTANT**: The Shared Memory Coordinator is **NOT a separate PostgreSQL worker process**. It is:

- **Shared Memory Data Structure**: Allocated in PostgreSQL's shared memory segment during startup
- **Accessible by All Processes**: Main PostgreSQL process, apply workers, background workers, client connections
- **No IPC Required**: Direct in-memory access within the same PostgreSQL instance
- **Thread-Safe**: Protected by LWLock for concurrent access across multiple processes
- **Persistent**: Survives process restarts within the same PostgreSQL server instance

### Production Benefits

- **Zero Data Loss**: Preserves all unacknowledged transactions during node failure scenarios
- **Manual DBA Control**: Database administrators maintain full control over recovery timing and methods
- **Enterprise Ready**: Complete error handling, resource cleanup, and production-grade reliability
- **High Availability**: Any single node can fail permanently without risking data loss
- **Operational Clarity**: Clear, documented procedures with specific guidance for each recovery step

## 5. Enterprise Recovery Execution Framework

### 5.1 Authorized Recovery Workflow Procedures

The following operational framework outlines the comprehensive step-by-step procedures for executing Recovery Slots during catastrophic infrastructure failure scenarios:

| Step | Phase | Action | SQL Command | Expected Outcome | Notes |
|------|-------|--------|-------------|------------------|-------|
| **0** | **Detection** | **Manually verify node failure** | `N/A - DBA judgment` | **Confirmed node is permanently down** | **DBA checks connectivity, logs, monitoring** |
| 1 | **Assessment** | Verify cluster health and identify inconsistencies | `SELECT * FROM spock.quick_health_check();` | Identifies data gaps and recovery requirements | Run on any healthy node |
| 2 | **Analysis** | Get specific recovery recommendations | `SELECT spock.list_recovery_recommendations();` | Provides actionable recovery commands | Review PostgreSQL logs for detailed guidance |
| 3 | **Node Removal** | Safely remove failed node while preserving recovery slots | `SELECT * FROM spock.drop_node_with_recovery('failed_node');` | Node removed, recovery slots preserved in stale state | Execute on all healthy nodes |
| 4 | **Data Transfer** | Transfer missing transactions between healthy nodes | `SELECT spock.manual_recover_data('source_node', 'target_node');` | Missing transactions replicated to target node | Repeat for each identified inconsistency |
| 5 | **Verification** | Confirm all data inconsistencies are resolved | `SELECT * FROM spock.quick_health_check();` | All nodes show HEALTHY status | Run on any node in the cluster |
| 6 | **Status Review** | Review final recovery slot status | `SELECT * FROM spock.get_recovery_slot_status();` | Shows current state of all recovery slots | Optional: Verify cleanup completion |

### 5.2 Detailed Command Reference

#### Step 0: Manual Node Failure Detection

**Purpose**: Confirm that a node has experienced catastrophic failure before initiating recovery
**Expected Outcome**: DBA judgment that the node is permanently unavailable

**Detection Methods:**
- **Network Connectivity**: `ping`, `telnet`, or connection attempts to PostgreSQL port
- **Database Connectivity**: `psql` connection attempts from other nodes
- **System Monitoring**: Check server status, disk space, power status
- **Log Analysis**: Review PostgreSQL logs for crash indicators
- **Cluster Heartbeat**: Check if node responds to cluster health checks

**Critical Decision**: Recovery slots are designed for **permanent** node failures. Do not use recovery slots for temporary outages or network partitions.

---

#### Step 1: Health Assessment
```sql
-- Execute on any healthy node
SELECT * FROM spock.quick_health_check();
```
**Purpose**: Identifies cluster inconsistencies and data gaps
**Expected Output**: Status table showing PROBLEM areas requiring attention

#### Step 2: Recovery Analysis
```sql
-- Execute to get specific recovery guidance
SELECT spock.list_recovery_recommendations();
```
**Purpose**: Provides intelligent analysis and specific recovery commands
**Expected Output**: Detailed recommendations with exact SQL commands to execute

#### Step 3: Node Removal with Recovery Preservation
```sql
-- Execute on ALL healthy nodes (replace 'n1' with actual failed node name)
SELECT * FROM spock.drop_node_with_recovery('n1');
```
**Purpose**: Safely removes failed node while preserving recovery slots
**Expected Output**: Confirmation of node removal and slot preservation

#### Step 4: Manual Data Recovery
```sql
-- Execute for each identified inconsistency (replace node names as needed)
SELECT spock.manual_recover_data('source_node', 'target_node');
```
**Purpose**: Transfers missing transactions using recovery slots
**Internal Process**: WAL scanning, slot advancement, temporary subscription creation
**Expected Output**: Confirmation of successful data transfer and cleanup

#### Step 5: Final Verification
```sql
-- Execute to confirm recovery completion
SELECT * FROM spock.quick_health_check();
```
**Purpose**: Validates that all inconsistencies have been resolved
**Expected Output**: All status indicators show HEALTHY

### 5.3 Operational Considerations

#### Prerequisites
- **Step 0 - Failure Confirmation**: DBA must manually verify the node has permanently failed
- **Access Requirements**: Database administrator privileges on all healthy nodes
- **Node Connectivity**: All healthy nodes must be accessible and operational
- **Cluster Stability**: Ongoing replication between healthy nodes should be stable

#### Error Handling
- **Timeout Management**: Operations include built-in timeouts and progress monitoring
- **Resource Cleanup**: Automatic cleanup of temporary resources on success or failure
- **Rollback Capability**: Failed operations do not leave partial state

#### Monitoring and Logging
- **Progress Tracking**: Real-time progress updates in PostgreSQL logs
- **Detailed Logging**: Comprehensive logging of all recovery operations
- **Status Visibility**: Multiple functions provide visibility into recovery state

- **Automated Node Failure Detection**: Manual DBA verification required
- **Background Recovery Processes**: No automatic recovery initiation
- **Internal Orchestration**: Manual DBA-driven workflow management
### Key Design Decisions

#### Manual DBA Control
The implementation prioritizes manual DBA control over automated recovery processes. Database administrators explicitly verify node failures and execute recovery commands, providing full visibility and control over critical operations.

#### Single Node Failure Focus
The current implementation focuses on single catastrophic node failures. Multiple simultaneous node failures require additional coordination and are not covered in the initial implementation.

#### Traditional Progress Tracking
Progress tracking continues to use traditional database tables rather than shared memory structures, maintaining compatibility with existing PostgreSQL infrastructure.

### Key Divergences from Framing Document

Our implementation diverges significantly from the original "Recovery Slots – Framing Document" in core architectural and operational approaches:

#### **1. Manual DBA Control vs Automated Orchestration**
- **Framing Document**: "Automated detection of node failure and initiation of recovery via orchestration"
- **Framing FAQ**: "Transaction / Data synchronization should happen automatically"
- **Our Implementation**: Manual DBA verification, command execution, and monitoring
- **Impact**: DBA intervention required vs promised automation

#### **2. Traditional Tables vs Shared Memory Architecture**
- **Framing Document**: "Need moved to shared memory... we need the Spock Resource Manager first"
- **Framing Document**: "Broadcast from output plugin, Consume by apply worker"
- **Our Implementation**: Traditional database table-based progress tracking, no inter-process communication
- **Impact**: Functional but lacks the advanced coordination architecture specified

#### **3. External Orchestration vs Internal Orchestration**
- **Framing Document**: References automated workflows and orchestration throughout
- **Framing Document**: "Internal Orchestration" listed as explicitly out-of-scope (but contradicted by automation promises)
- **Our Implementation**: External DBA-driven orchestration via SQL commands
- **Impact**: Manual coordination vs automatic system-level orchestration

#### **4. No Automatic Failure Detection**
- **Framing Document**: Implies automatic detection through orchestration systems
- **Our Implementation**: Manual DBA verification of node failure
- **Impact**: Human judgment required vs automatic system detection

#### **5. Single Node Scope vs Multiple Node Handling**
- **Framing Document**: "Examination of Multiple-Node Failure situation... what happens if more than 1 node went down"
- **Our Implementation**: Single catastrophic node failure scenarios only
- **Impact**: Limited resilience vs comprehensive multi-failure handling

#### **6. Manual Slot Management vs Automatic Lifecycle**
- **Framing Document**: "Make sure the DB Manager prunes the slot... slot creation and retention management logic"
- **Our Implementation**: Manual slot lifecycle management with no automatic pruning
- **Impact**: DBA cleanup required vs automated resource management

#### **7. No Resource Manager Integration**
- **Framing Document**: "We need the Resource Manager first, in order to move the Progress Table status to Shared memory"
- **Our Implementation**: Independent of Resource Manager, uses traditional PostgreSQL infrastructure
- **Impact**: Immediate deployability vs dependency on additional infrastructure

### Architectural Trade-offs

#### Scope vs Complexity
- **Decision**: Focus on single node failure recovery with manual DBA control
- **Rationale**: Provides reliable, understandable recovery procedures
- **Trade-off**: Requires DBA intervention but ensures predictability

#### Compatibility vs Performance
- **Decision**: Maintain traditional table-based progress tracking
- **Rationale**: Immediate compatibility with existing PostgreSQL infrastructure
- **Trade-off**: Performance characteristics differ from shared memory approach

#### Control vs Automation
- **Decision**: Manual DBA orchestration over automatic rescue operations
- **Rationale**: Ensures DBA visibility and prevents unintended operations
- **Trade-off**: Requires trained personnel but provides full operational control
- **Implementation**: **NODE REMOVAL ONLY** - no automatic replacement
- **Impact**: Covers catastrophic failure recovery but not full HA automation

│   Test Node A   │    │   Test Node B   │    │   Test Node C   │
│ (Primary Test)  │◄──►│ (Backup Test)   │◄──►│ (Witness Test)  │
│ Port: 5432      │    │ Port: 5433      │    │ Port: 5434      │
│ Financial TX    │    │ User Profiles   │    │ Inventory       │
└─────────────────┘    └─────────────────┘    └─────────────────┘
```

### 8.3 Test Scenarios

#### Scenario 1: Single Node Catastrophic Failure
**Objective**: Validate complete data recovery from single node failure

**Setup**:
- Generate transaction load: 1000 financial transactions, 500 user registrations, 300 inventory updates
- Ensure transactions are partially replicated (some acknowledged, some pending)

**Failure Simulation**:
```bash
# Simulate catastrophic failure on Node A (port 5432)
sudo systemctl stop postgresql-15  # Or equivalent service command
# OR force kill PostgreSQL process
kill -9 $(pgrep -f "postgres.*5432")
# OR simulate disk failure
sudo mount -t tmpfs -o size=1M tmpfs /var/lib/postgresql/data
```

**DBA Recovery Process**:
1. **Step 0**: Verify Node A is unreachable via `ping`, `psql`, and system monitoring
2. **Step 1**: Run `SELECT * FROM spock.quick_health_check();` on Node B or C
3. **Step 2**: Execute `SELECT spock.list_recovery_recommendations();` for guidance
4. **Step 3**: Remove failed node: `SELECT * FROM spock.drop_node_with_recovery('node_a');`
5. **Step 4**: Transfer missing data: `SELECT spock.manual_recover_data('node_b', 'node_c');`
6. **Step 5**: Verify recovery: `SELECT * FROM spock.quick_health_check();`

**Expected Issues & Solutions**:
- **Issue**: Node removal fails due to active connections
  - **Solution**: Force disconnect sessions before removal
- **Issue**: Recovery slot advancement fails
  - **Solution**: Check WAL availability and disk space
- **Issue**: Data transfer times out
  - **Solution**: Increase timeout or reduce batch size

#### Scenario 2: Recovery Workflow Validation
**Objective**: Test complete DBA recovery procedure

**Controlled Failure Setup**:
```sql
-- Create known data gaps for testing
-- 1. Stop replication on one node temporarily
SELECT spock.sub_disable('node_b_to_node_c_subscription');

-- 2. Generate transactions that won't be replicated
INSERT INTO test_table SELECT generate_series(1,1000), 'test_data_' || generate_series(1,1000);

-- 3. Simulate node failure
-- Kill Node C's PostgreSQL process
kill -9 $(psql -h localhost -p 5434 -U postgres -t -c "SELECT pg_backend_pid();")
```

**DBA Recovery Steps**:
```sql
-- Step 1: Health assessment
SELECT * FROM spock.quick_health_check();

-- Step 2: Get specific recommendations
SELECT spock.list_recovery_recommendations();

-- Step 3: Remove failed node with recovery slot preservation
SELECT * FROM spock.drop_node_with_recovery('node_c');

-- Step 4: Transfer missing transactions from Node B to Node C
SELECT spock.manual_recover_data('node_b', 'node_c');

-- Step 5: Final verification
SELECT * FROM spock.quick_health_check();
SELECT * FROM spock.get_recovery_slot_status();
```

**Success Criteria**:
- All workflow steps execute without errors
- Recovery completes within acceptable time limits
- No manual intervention required beyond documented procedures

#### Scenario 3: Edge Cases and Error Handling
**Objective**: Validate robustness under adverse conditions

**Test Case: Network Interruption During Recovery**
```bash
# Simulate network failure during Step 4
# 1. Start recovery process
# 2. Interrupt network during data transfer
iptables -A INPUT -s <node_ip> -j DROP
# 3. Wait for timeout/failure
# 4. Restore network
iptables -D INPUT -s <node_ip> -j DROP
# 5. Resume or restart recovery
```

**DBA Resolution**:
```sql
-- Check recovery status
SELECT * FROM spock.get_recovery_slot_status();

-- If recovery failed, restart the process
SELECT spock.manual_recover_data('source_node', 'target_node');

-- Verify completion
SELECT * FROM spock.quick_health_check();
```

**Test Case: Resource Exhaustion**
```bash
# Simulate disk space issues
# Fill disk to 95% capacity
dd if=/dev/zero of=/tmp/fill_disk bs=1M count=19000

# Attempt recovery - should fail gracefully
SELECT spock.manual_recover_data('node_b', 'node_c');
```

**DBA Resolution**:
```sql
-- Check system resources
SELECT * FROM spock.quick_health_check();

-- Free disk space and retry
-- rm /tmp/fill_disk
SELECT spock.manual_recover_data('node_b', 'node_c');
```

**Test Case: Invalid DBA Commands**
```sql
-- DBA enters wrong node name
SELECT * FROM spock.drop_node_with_recovery('nonexistent_node');
-- Expected: Clear error message

-- DBA tries to recover from failed node
SELECT spock.manual_recover_data('failed_node', 'healthy_node');
-- Expected: Validation error
```

**DBA Error Recovery**:
```sql
-- Always check health first
SELECT * FROM spock.quick_health_check();

-- Get fresh recommendations after errors
SELECT spock.list_recovery_recommendations();

-- Retry with correct parameters
SELECT spock.manual_recover_data('correct_source', 'correct_target');
```

### 8.4 Validation Procedures

#### Data Consistency Validation
```sql
-- Compare transaction counts across nodes
SELECT node_name, transaction_count, last_transaction_id
FROM spock.node_transaction_summary;

-- Validate specific transaction presence
SELECT transaction_id, node_presence
FROM spock.cross_node_transaction_audit
WHERE transaction_id IN ('critical_tx_001', 'critical_tx_002');
```

#### Performance Impact Assessment
```sql
-- Measure recovery operation timing
SELECT operation, start_time, end_time, duration_seconds
FROM spock.recovery_operation_log
WHERE test_run_id = 'scenario_1_run_001';

-- Assess resource usage during recovery
SELECT metric, value, timestamp
FROM spock.recovery_performance_metrics
ORDER BY timestamp;
```

#### Cluster Health Verification
```sql
-- Comprehensive health check
SELECT * FROM spock.quick_health_check();

-- Detailed recovery slot status
SELECT * FROM spock.get_recovery_slot_status();

-- Replication status validation
SELECT subscription_name, status, lag_seconds
FROM spock.subscription_status;
