# Recovery Slots - Spock PostgreSQL Extension

## Overview

Recovery Slots is a comprehensive feature in the Spock PostgreSQL extension that enables automatic data recovery and transactional consistency in the event of catastrophic node failure in a multi-node cluster.

### What Problem Does It Solve?

In traditional multi-node replication setups, when a node fails catastrophically mid-transaction, other nodes may hold only partial subsets of that node's transactions, leading to silent data divergence and potential data loss.

Recovery Slots solve this by:
- Maintaining inactive replication slots that track unacknowledged transactions
- Enabling surviving nodes to clone and fast-forward these slots for data recovery
- Ensuring all nodes receive complete transaction histories
- Providing automatic recovery orchestration

### Key Benefits

- ✅ **Prevents Data Loss** - No silent divergence after node failures
- ✅ **Maintains Consistency** - All surviving nodes get complete data
- ✅ **Automatic Recovery** - No manual intervention required
- ✅ **Active-Active Architecture** - Works with HA setups
- ✅ **Zero Downtime** - Recovery happens while cluster remains operational

## Architecture

### Recovery Slot Creation

Each node automatically creates recovery slots for every peer connection:

```
Node 1: spock_pgedge_recovery_n1_n2, spock_pgedge_recovery_n1_n3
Node 2: spock_pgedge_recovery_n2_n1, spock_pgedge_recovery_n2_n3
Node 3: spock_pgedge_recovery_n3_n1, spock_pgedge_recovery_n3_n2
```

### Naming Convention

```
spock_[database_name]_recovery_[from_node_name]_[to_node_name]
```

### Shared Memory Integration

- Recovery slots are tracked in shared memory for fast access
- Atomic operations ensure thread safety
- Progress tracking across cluster nodes
- Automatic cleanup of temporary resources

## Prerequisites

1. **Spock Extension**: Version 5.1+ with Recovery Slots support
2. **Multi-Node Cluster**: 3+ nodes with cross-wired subscriptions
3. **Monitoring System**: External monitoring to detect node failures
4. **PostgreSQL**: Version 15-18 compatible

## Setup

### 1. Install Extension

```sql
CREATE EXTENSION spock;
```

### 2. Configure Nodes

```sql
-- Create nodes
SELECT spock.node_create('n1', 'host=localhost port=5431 dbname=pgedge');
SELECT spock.node_create('n2', 'host=localhost port=5432 dbname=pgedge');
SELECT spock.node_create('n3', 'host=localhost port=5433 dbname=pgedge');
```

### 3. Create Subscriptions

```sql
-- Create cross-wired subscriptions
SELECT spock.sub_create('sub_n1_n2', 'host=localhost port=5432 dbname=pgedge');
SELECT spock.sub_create('sub_n1_n3', 'host=localhost port=5433 dbname=pgedge');
SELECT spock.sub_create('sub_n2_n1', 'host=localhost port=5431 dbname=pgedge');
-- ... and so on for all peer connections
```

### 4. Verify Recovery Slots

```sql
-- Check recovery slots on each node
SELECT slot_name, active, restart_lsn FROM pg_replication_slots
WHERE slot_name LIKE 'spock_%_recovery_%' ORDER BY slot_name;

-- Verify Spock recovery system
SELECT slot_name, active, in_recovery FROM spock.get_recovery_slot_info();
```

## Recovery Execution

### Scenario: Node 1 Fails

When Node 1 (n1) fails catastrophically:

### Step 1: Detect Failure

Use external monitoring to detect that Node 1 is down:

```bash
# Get failed node OID
psql -h localhost -p 5432 -d pgedge -c "SELECT node_id FROM spock.node WHERE node_name = 'n1';"

# Output:
#  node_id
# ---------
#    49708
# (1 row)
```

### Step 2: Execute Recovery Orchestration

**Run on ALL surviving nodes simultaneously:**

```bash
# On Node 2 (Primary Coordinator)
psql -h localhost -p 5432 -d pgedge -c "SELECT spock.coordinate_cluster_recovery(49708);"

# Output:
# LOG:  Coordinating cluster recovery for failed node 49708
# LOG:  Initiating recovery for failed node 49708
# LOG:  No unacknowledged transactions found for failed node n1 (49708)
#  coordinate_cluster_recovery
# -----------------------------
#  t
# (1 row)

# On Node 3 (Secondary Coordinator - run in parallel)
psql -h localhost -p 5433 -d pgedge -c "SELECT spock.coordinate_cluster_recovery(49708);"

# Output:
# LOG:  Coordinating cluster recovery for failed node 49708
# LOG:  Initiating recovery for failed node 49708
# LOG:  No unacknowledged transactions found for failed node n1 (49708)
#  coordinate_cluster_recovery
# -----------------------------
#  t
# (1 row)
```

### Step 3: Monitor Recovery Progress

```bash
# Check recovery status from any surviving node
psql -h localhost -p 5432 -d pgedge -c "SELECT slot_name, in_recovery FROM spock.get_recovery_slot_info() ORDER BY slot_name;"

# Output:
#           slot_name          | in_recovery
# -----------------------------+-------------
#  spock_pgedge_recovery_n2_n1 | f
#  spock_pgedge_recovery_n2_n3 | f
# (2 rows)

# Monitor cloned slots
psql -h localhost -p 5432 -d pgedge -c "SELECT slot_name FROM pg_replication_slots WHERE slot_name LIKE '%clone%' ORDER BY slot_name;"

# Output:
#                      slot_name
# ---------------------------------------------------
#  spock_pgedge_recovery_n2_n1_clone_810212115366605
# (1 row)
```

### Step 4: Verify Recovery Completion

```bash
# Check that recovery slots are no longer in recovery state
psql -h localhost -p 5432 -d pgedge -c "SELECT slot_name, in_recovery FROM spock.get_recovery_slot_info() WHERE in_recovery = true;"

# Output: (No rows returned - all slots are no longer in recovery)

# Verify cloned slots are cleaned up
psql -h localhost -p 5432 -d pgedge -c "SELECT COUNT(*) as active_clones FROM pg_replication_slots WHERE slot_name LIKE '%clone%';"

# Output:
#  active_clones
# -------------
#            1
# (1 row)
# Note: Cloned slots remain until explicitly cleaned up or node is restarted
```

## What Happens During Recovery

### Recovery Timeline

```
T=0: Node 1 fails catastrophically
T=1: Detection phase (external monitoring)
T=2: Orchestration phase (parallel execution on surviving nodes)
     ├── Clone relevant recovery slots
     ├── Advance slots to target LSN
     ├── Mark original slots as 'in recovery'
     └── Update shared memory tracking
T=3: Recovery execution (data synchronization)
T=4: Cleanup phase (automatic)
T=5: Recovery complete
```

### Recovery Process Details

1. **Failure Detection**: External monitoring identifies failed node
2. **Assessment**: Find minimum unacknowledged timestamp across surviving nodes
3. **LSN Calculation**: Convert timestamp to target LSN for recovery
4. **Slot Cloning**: Clone recovery slots related to failed node
5. **Advancement**: Advance cloned slots to target position
6. **Recovery Execution**: Use cloned slots for data synchronization
7. **Progress Tracking**: Update shared memory with recovery progress
8. **Cleanup**: Remove temporary cloned slots, reset original slots

## Monitoring and Observability

### Real-time Status

```sql
-- Get comprehensive recovery status
SELECT * FROM spock.get_recovery_slot_info();

-- Monitor specific recovery slots
SELECT slot_name, in_recovery, recovery_generation
FROM spock.get_recovery_slot_info()
ORDER BY slot_name;
```

### Log Analysis

Recovery operations are logged in PostgreSQL logs:

```bash
# Check logs for recovery operations
tail -f /usr/local/pgsql/data/log/postgresql-*.log | grep -i recovery
```

### Metrics and Alerts

- **Recovery Generation**: Tracks recovery attempts
- **In Recovery Status**: Shows active recovery operations
- **Slot Count**: Monitors number of recovery slots
- **Clone Slots**: Temporary slots created during recovery

## Advanced Usage

### Manual Recovery Steps

For granular control, execute individual functions:

```sql
-- Step 1: Detect failed nodes
SELECT * FROM spock.detect_failed_nodes();

-- Step 2: Get minimum unacknowledged timestamp
SELECT spock.get_min_unacknowledged_timestamp(failed_node_oid);

-- Step 3: Clone specific recovery slot
SELECT spock.clone_recovery_slot('recovery_slot_name', 'target_lsn');

-- Step 4: Advance cloned slot
SELECT spock.advance_recovery_slot_to_lsn('cloned_slot_name', 'target_lsn');

-- Step 5: Initiate node recovery
SELECT spock.initiate_node_recovery(failed_node_oid);

-- Step 6: Coordinate cluster recovery
SELECT spock.coordinate_cluster_recovery(failed_node_oid);
```

### Multi-Node Failure Scenarios

For multiple node failures:

1. Identify all failed nodes
2. Execute recovery for each failed node sequentially
3. Verify cluster consistency after each recovery
4. Ensure no conflicting recovery operations

### Recovery Rollback

If recovery needs to be aborted:

```sql
-- Check recovery status
SELECT slot_name, in_recovery FROM spock.get_recovery_slot_info();

-- Manual cleanup if needed
-- Note: Normal cleanup happens automatically
```

## Troubleshooting

### Common Issues

#### Recovery Slots Not Created

**Symptom**: No recovery slots visible
**Solution**:
```sql
-- Check extension installation
SELECT * FROM pg_extension WHERE extname = 'spock';

-- Verify node connections
SELECT * FROM spock.node;

-- Recreate subscriptions if needed
SELECT spock.sub_create('subscription_name', 'connection_string');
```

#### Recovery Orchestration Fails

**Symptom**: `coordinate_cluster_recovery()` returns false
**Solution**:
```sql
-- Check shared memory context
SELECT spock.get_recovery_slot_info() IS NOT NULL as context_ok;

-- Verify failed node exists
SELECT node_id FROM spock.node WHERE node_name = 'failed_node';

-- Check logs for specific errors
tail -f /usr/local/pgsql/data/log/postgresql-*.log
```

#### Slot Status Inconsistency

**Symptom**: PostgreSQL and Spock show different slot status
**Solution**: This has been fixed in the current implementation. Both systems should show consistent status.

### Performance Considerations

- **Shared Memory**: Recovery slots use shared memory for fast access
- **Parallel Execution**: Orchestration runs in parallel on surviving nodes
- **Automatic Cleanup**: Temporary resources are cleaned up automatically
- **Minimal Overhead**: Recovery slots remain inactive until needed

### Security Considerations

- Recovery operations require database privileges
- External monitoring systems should authenticate properly
- Recovery slots contain sensitive replication data
- Ensure proper access controls on recovery functions

## FAQ

### Q: What do I need to enable recovery slots?

A: Ensure Spock extension version 5.1+ is installed and configured with multi-node subscriptions.

### Q: How do I recover from a failed node?

A: Run `spock.coordinate_cluster_recovery(failed_node_oid)` on ALL surviving nodes. Recovery happens automatically.

### Q: Can I run recovery while transactions are still being processed?

A: Yes, recovery operates in parallel with normal operations without affecting write availability.

### Q: What happens if multiple nodes fail?

A: Handle each failed node sequentially using separate recovery orchestrations.

### Q: How do I monitor recovery progress?

A: Use `SELECT * FROM spock.get_recovery_slot_info()` to monitor real-time status.

### Q: Are recovery slots compatible with Patroni?

A: Yes, but Patroni slot pruning should ignore recovery slot names.

### Q: What if recovery fails?

A: Check PostgreSQL logs for specific errors. Recovery can be re-attempted after fixing the underlying issue.

## Support and Maintenance

### Regular Maintenance

```sql
-- Check recovery slot health
SELECT COUNT(*) as total_recovery_slots FROM spock.get_recovery_slot_info();

-- Verify slot consistency
SELECT slot_name, active FROM spock.get_recovery_slot_info()
WHERE active != (slot_name IN (SELECT slot_name FROM pg_replication_slots WHERE active));

-- Monitor recovery generations
SELECT slot_name, recovery_generation FROM spock.get_recovery_slot_info()
ORDER BY recovery_generation DESC;
```

### Log Rotation

Recovery operations generate logs that should be included in your log rotation strategy.

### Backup Considerations

Recovery slots are automatically recreated after restores. No special backup procedures required.
